2 how about something with 4 stars and something expensive	i have 2 options for you - the huntingdon marriott on the west side and the university arms in the center are you interested in one of these ?
3 maybe is either one a 4 star hotel ? if so i d like to book a room for 4 nights	both are 4 stars how many days would you be staying and how many people are in your party ? i can see if something is available
4 i need a reservation for 4 nights starting saturday	how many are in your party ?
5 3 people can i get the reference number please ?	i m sorry but there is nothing available at that time at either hotel would you like to try fewer nights or perhaps a different arrival day ?

1 i m curious about the 3-star lodging options available in cambridge	there are no 3-star lodgings available in cambridge shall we check 4-star locations instead ?
2 sure check only for hotels which include free parking also	there are no 4-star lodgings available in cambridge that meet your criteria shall we check 5-star locations instead ?
3 yes please try 5-star hotels with free parking	unfortunately i couldn t find anything with 5 stars
4 try out 1 night then	i do not have 4 or 5 star hotels in that area can i try something else ?
5 i want to stay at a 3 star hotel with free parking	i m sorry for the confusion there are two expensive hotels with 3 stars and parking do you prefer the centre or the south ?
6 the centre will be fine thank you	all right sir that would be the gonville hotel on gonville place
7 ok could you book it for 8 people starting wednesday for 2 nights please	i m sorry booking was unsuccessful would you like to try a shorter stay ?
8 yes could you try for one night ?	very good sir that worked and i have a reference number for you: pu74excq
9 that s all i need thanks ever so much !	you re very welcome i m terribly sorry about the confusion earlier have a lovely day goodbye

1 i m looking for an expensive hotel with free wifi	i have about 5 different ones all spread out over town do you have a certain preference on the area to stay in ?
2 not really on the area but i would like an expensive guesthouse	i m afraid we don t have any guesthouses in that price range can i offer you something else instead ?
3 ok well i guess a cheap one would work just as well i need a place to stay i would just still need free wifi	we have 9 guesthouse that are cheap with free wifi do you have any other specific needs ?
4 no i don t think so which one sounds the best ?	i think you d enjoy the el shaddai would you like to make a reservation ?
5 wait...is that a restaurant ? i want a guesthouse i m so confused	the el shaddai is indeed a cheaply priced guesthouse with free wi-fi according to our database perhaps they do both may i make a reservation for you ?
6 oh ok sure go ahead and book 4 nights from tuesday there will be three of us	sorry it is booked up then would you like to try a shorter stay ?
7 no i need it for 4 nights i try another time thanks	please let me know any other way i can help
8 could you look again for a place in the cheap range area does not matter	i apologize there are not any cheap guesthouses available for your dates would you like to try a hotel or a shorter stay ?
9 you don t have a cheap guesthouse (any area) with free wifi for tuesday 4 nights 3 people ? could you please check again ?	i have booked you for alexander bed and breakfast reference number: h02psc79 is there anything else you need ?
10 no that s everything i needed today thank you	ok have a nice day bye
