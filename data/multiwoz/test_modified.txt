1 hi i need a place to stay something expensive on the north side	i m sorry but there is not a single expensive hotel or guesthouse on the north side of town would you like a different area or perhaps a different price range ?	['single', 'expensive', 'hotel', 'guesthouse', 'north']
2 how about any part of town with free parking and free wifi ?	i have 5 different options for you my recommendation would be the huntingdon_marriott_hotel its in the west side and is expensive with a 4-star rating would that work ?	['west', 'huntingdon_marriott_hotel', 'expensive']
3 is there something in the cheap price range ?	there are 2 cheap guesthouses if you still want to stay on the north side of town they both have internet and parking would either of these work ?	['north', '2', 'cheap']
4 yes please i ll need the phone number and hotel type please	all right the worth_house is a guesthouse that should meet your needs the phone number is 01223316074 what other informatoin do you need ?	['guesthouse', '01223316074', 'worth_house']
5 that s all i need thank you	thanks for using the cambridge towninfo centre and enjoy your stay in our city !	['centre']
