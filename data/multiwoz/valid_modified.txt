1 howdy i m looking for a moderately priced place to stay i d like a place with free parking	there are many places that meet that criteria do you have any other preferences ?	[]
2 i prefer a hotel rather than a guesthouse with a rating of at least 3 stars	i have nothing with that exact criteria perhaps something with a bit of a change in criteria ?	[]
3 how about an expensive one ?	i have gonville_hotel in the centre and the_lensfield_hotel in the south that both meet your needs would you like to book one of these two ?	['the_lensfield_hotel', 'centre', 'gonville_hotel', 'south']
4 yes either of those should work although i would prefer the_lensfield_hotel since its in the south	ok ! i can book a room for you if you can tell me the day you re arriving how many nights you need and the number of people in your party	[]
5 please book for 4 people and 5 nights starting from saturday	i m sorry the_lensfield_hotel does not have anything available then would you like me to try the gonville_hotel for you ?	['the_lensfield_hotel', 'gonville_hotel']
6 yes anything in the same price range will work	i was able to book a room at the gonville for you ref#ae00vohe can i help you with anything else today ?	[]
7 no thank you that is all i need today	thank you for using this service enjoy your stay good bye	[]
